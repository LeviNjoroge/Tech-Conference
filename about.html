                          <p><strong>Digital Inclusion</strong> are the activities necessary for the use of Information Communication Technologies by everyone irrespective of the conditional ties. The key pillars that are to be promoted through Digital Inclusion are:</p>

                          <ul class="about-list">
                              <li>Relevant digital skill training (skill development).</li>
                              <li>Adequate infrastructure and use of digital tools.</li>
                              <li>Affordable use of broadband connectivity.</li>
                              <li>Provision of quality technical support.</li>
                              <li>Right policy and regulation framework.</li>
                          </ul>

                          <p><strong>Africa Digital Inclusion Alliance</strong> is a non-profit organization that is aimed to promote these key pillars in primary schools, high schools, colleges, refugee camps, and community centers using different developmental approaches. ADIA will hold different workshops in these places which is also aimed at affiliated impact-driven initiatives. The target group has specific learning materials that have been fully designed to be used during the workshops, ADIA also provides technological devices such as laptops, tablets, and desktops to be used during the workshops. Both the instructors are also provided by ADIA during the workshops. The learning is fully psychomotor oriented in delivery of specific skill or knowledge content hence the learning is more engaging and enjoyable.</p>

                                    This is one of the most important foundational projects of the Africa Digital Inclusion Alliance as it aims to be conducted in every school across the continent. The workshops will be organized on specific topics of tech that will be mostly hands-on as the learners will have opportunity, time, and space to interact with whatever topic they are learning, even within the scope of their syllabus.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    There will be a learner's activity sheet on the specific topic, the learner’s handout, instructor’s presentation slides, and an instructor's guide on the topic. For example, when the workshop is based on "Basics of Cybersecurity", there will be the "Basics of Cybersecurity Learner’s Handout", "Basics of Cybersecurity Learner’s Activity Sheet", "Basics of Cybersecurity Instructor Presentation", and "Basics of Cybersecurity Instructor Guide". Specific files will also assist in achieving the objectives of topics covered when necessary.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The learners will fill the Workshop pre-evaluation form before the workshop to track the general knowledge of the learner on that specific topic and the Workshop post-evaluation form to know the achievement from the workshops. The learner’s handout sheet, activity sheet, pre and post evaluation forms will be used by teachers and parents to know the impact of the workshop on the learners, and we will have suggestion forms printed by teachers so that ADIA can improve the workshop to be the best delivery mode depending on the target audience.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    After two weeks of the training, there will be a follow-back evaluation survey form, which seeks to track the learners' progress with the knowledge.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    For a good workshop to occur for every 100 learners, there should be no less than 10 laptops, charging extensions, a projector for the presentation of the slides, printed learner’s handout and activity sheet, and pre and post evaluation forms.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The workshop venue is to be made ready 30 minutes earlier before the workshop begins with the following arranged: every learner is to be given the activity sheets and power cables rightfully placed to avoid shocks and accidents. Every learner will only attend the workshops after filling the evaluation form with the assistance of the instructors and school teachers. The computers should be connected to the internet before the workshops begin for ease in operation.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    For any workshop to occur, it must have 1 presenter and 3 other guide-instructors during the workshop to make it easy for the execution and practical engagement with the learning content. The school teachers might assist during the workshop process.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The workshop will take place depending on the program structure; however, a good workshop should not be less than 3 to 5 hours.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Conditions for a workshop to occur in any school:</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>More than 100 students should subscribe to the workshop by paying a specific amount of KSH.200/$2 for schools with more than 200 learners from grade 2 to grade 8. For schools with less than 100 learners, more than half should subscribe by paying the workshop fee.</li>
                                    <li>The school must agree to open a bank savings account for the building of the computer laboratory, where 30% of the amount of money will be saved for a given period. This amount of money will be a signatory agreement between the Head administration of the school and the ADIA head office.</li>
                                    <li>The school must agree to schedule workshops as part of their calendar of study period (term) and coordinate the prerequisite preparations for conducting the workshops.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <h3>Financial Model Strategy (Financial Distribution Policy)</h3>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>50% will be sent to ADIA’s organization’s account to assist in the coordination process and other facilitations geared towards bettering the initiative. This amount will be reimbursed to the institutions for the quick equipping and building of the computer laboratory once savings have reached a specific required threshold.</li>
                                    <li>30% will be driven to the savings plan, a collaborative partnership of the institution and ADIA on building the computer labs and later technical support provisions. This will ensure the sustainability of the program once it begins in any school.</li>
                                    <li>20% will go to the other affiliated projects of ADIA, including the climate action strategy promoting SDG Goal 13 through local-level mechanisms and initiatives such as agro-tech to enable each child to have a laptop by the 4th grade.</li>
                                </ol>
                                <p>
                                    Workshops will happen at least once a month in every school under the program within the term or period of learning. We are targeting 10,000 participants in the first phase of this initiative.

                                                This program will be implemented immediately after the institution adopts the workshops to be conducted. The computer laboratory can either involve building a new space or equipping an existing one to function as a fully operational lab.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                As part of the financing plan, 30% of the savings scheme will be topped up by ADIA and its partners to build and fully equip the lab with the necessary technological tools, ensuring the integration of technology into the school curriculum.
                                            </p>

                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Allowing teachers to access relevant learning content for students.</li>
                                    <li>Promoting ease of communication between heads of departments and administrative offices.</li>
                                    <li>Exposing teachers to various digital learning tools that increase their productivity.</li>
                                    <li>Allowing students to access specific websites and videos for enhanced learning.</li>
                                    <li>Facilitating practical lessons and workshops through easy navigation to relevant information.</li>

                                    ADIA will connect all computer labs with broadband and collaborate with various ISPs to offer affordable connectivity solutions. This will help expand coverage to areas with low bandwidth and connectivity issues.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    ADIA will work closely with policymakers, stakeholders, and advocacy groups to ensure the provision of reliable and affordable broadband connectivity, while challenging obstructive policies to digital inclusion. Through campaigns and forums, ADIA will be a voice for the less informed and marginalized communities, advocating for better internet connectivity.
                                </p>

                                    Broadband connectivity will be co-funded by the institution and ADIA based on an agreed percentage. The institution will pay a monthly fee for the Wi-Fi and internet costs from the savings plan, though other payment plans are available. The infrastructural costs of internet connectivity will be covered from the institution’s savings plan, and the technical officer will ensure proper protocols are followed.

                                    <p>With rapid transformation and change in technology, there is a need for continuous knowledge sharing within society. The computer labs project is being installed in different institutions across Africa to support this effort.</p>
                                    <p>An adult is someone who is above 18 years old and has discontinued formal education. ADIA's training program is aimed at empowering such individuals through learning how to access governmental services, such as taxes, making applications, and using government websites. Participants will also learn to use recent technological tools and devices for improving productivity in their career, business, and daily life.</p>
                                
                                    <p>All training will be conducted by ADIA for free during the holidays when the computer labs are not in use. The goal is to support children by ensuring adults have the skills to assist them in accessing computers and online resources. To facilitate the implementation of this program, participants will be encouraged to support workshops by covering a small fee for certification.</p>

                                    <p>The certification fee is Ksh. 300 / $3, which will grant participants free access to the ADIA hub (white section) and free use of computers for personal use.

These dates must be approved by both ADIA and the institution, with the school making requests to the institution for approval.

                                    <p>By 2030, Africa needs more than 700 data centers to have a productive digital economy. With the situation that Africa controls less than 2% of its data for a more digital inclusive society, our data infrastructure must have local ownership and funding for the need to be fully built and operational in different countries across Africa.</p>
            
                                    <p>The first phase to be undertaken by ADIA will have to influence the following as we aim to this important project of Africa. The pipeline for Data centers building will be in the following stages:</p>
                                    <ol>
                                      <li>Have a full locally mobilized funding strategy for our data centers building.</li>
                                      <li>Recruitment requires skills and expertise necessary to have a well-equipped team that is well prepared for the project (project preparation).</li>
                                      <li>Production and sourcing for reliable sources of energy to keep the data centers. This will be part of project preparation.</li>
                                      <li>Establish regional cooperation through policy design and simulation to address the different “national interests”. This will aim at improving the regulations beyond border strategy. We will adopt a concept called AfCFTA for Data Centers initiative.</li>
                                      <li>Having the right and accessible digital infrastructure for establishment of data centers. This is to allow affordable connectivity.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                    
                                    <p>The normal design for the Data centers will have to encompass the following:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                      <li>On-site meeting facilities</li>
                                      <li>Controlled access (multi-level security services, unique cabinet locks)</li>
                                      <li>Protection and management (destruction and replacement of data)</li>
                                      <li>Future-proof facilities to allow future access of information</li>
                                      <li>Design strategy (3, 4, 5 tier design)</li>
                                      <li>Cooling system design that is to give a positively pressured and dust-free environment</li>
                                      <li>Smart detection systems</li>
                                      <li>Video surveillance</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    
                                    <p>The data centers will have its connectivity to and from the cloud ramp to its services through teleput, wireless, and fiber connectivity to even the landlocked countries in Africa, and that is why free borders for our data sovereignty is key.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>ADIA will have a strategic-partner centric approach with Google, Amazon, Microsoft Azure, and Alibaba in provision of internet access and promotion of digital enterprise.</p>

                                    <p>In Africa, agriculture accounts for close to 40% of its Gross Domestic Product. Linking agriculture to technology will not just make it a viable option but will make our economy more connected towards the provision of essential services and increasing food security. From the different crops planted and animals reared in different parts of the continent, there is a need for the transformation of the agricultural sector to be a major contributor to the technological sector, which should also be embraced for fruitful production to bring a more food-secure country.</p>
          
                                    <p>At ADIA, we have come up with a campaign strategy that creates awareness and brings economic value to farmers in different sectors through technology adoption. This is one of ADIA's efforts to promote food security and make it easy to access information on the agricultural sector.</p>
                                  
                                    <h3>ADIA's Approach to the Agro-Computer Campaign:</h3>
                                    <ol>
                                      <li>ADIA will establish ADIA Mixed Integrated Animal Farms that will aim at the production, rearing, and keeping of animals. These animals will be kept within the farm for use and leased to farmers. Among the animals that will be reared by ADIA will be chickens, sheep, cattle, goats, rabbits, and pigs.</li>
                                      <li>The rearing of animals will be in an integrated farm that is divided into different sections for different specific animals.</li>
                                      <li>The animals will be subjected to different treatments, and their use will be after maturity.</li>
                                      <li>The products obtained from the farm will be sold on behalf of the ADIA farm, and this will be used to improve the expansion of the farm and make it able to grow.</li>
                                      <li>ADIA will also receive animals through a buy-and-sell mechanism.</li>
                                      <li>The farm will also aid in the processing of its products like milk and meat, which will be exported and sold to increase the value chain of production.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                  
                                    <h3>One Laptop, One Animal Initiative:</h3>
                                    <p>ADIA will launch a program called the One Laptop, One Animal Initiative that allows learners from rural setups to receive a laptop by 4th grade. We will partner with different community groups and parent associations of different institutions.</p>
                                  
                                    <p>We shall lease two animals/birds depending on the request of the parent/guardian, who shall take care of the animal to reproduce. Through this, every beneficiary will have the ability to take care of the animal with support from ADIA. To ensure the success of this program, the following actions will be taken:</p>
                                  
                                    <ul>
                                      <li>Provide training to our beneficiaries on care and practices of keeping the animals safe and healthy.</li>
                                      <li>With the help of extension officers, provide free monthly checkups to the animals and recommend the best treatments, even for other animals. This means that if someone adopts this program, they will receive free consultancy services about the animals. This will only occur if there are more than 30 beneficiaries within the same region at the time of making this request.</li>
                                      <li>Collaborate with the climate agency to build dams/boreholes for areas with aridity and freely provide additive nutrients to the animals.</li>
                                      <li>Provide security to the animals during drought-stricken periods by providing food, water, and transportation.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                  
                                    <p>For example, when given two hens, one will be trained on handling and practices, and one will be provided with consultancy support. By the end of two years, we expect a rise in the number of hens. We will have an annual reward for the best keeper as a means of empowerment and appreciation. By the end of two years, we expect a farmer to have 200 new hens (which will be brought to the ADIA farm center at interval periods). Of these, only half will be for ADIA. The amount of money obtained will be used as collateral for the laptop for the learner so that by 4th grade, learners will own their laptops to be used for learning purposes.</p>
                                  
                                    <h3>ADIA's Partnerships and Initiatives:</h3>
                                    <ul>
                                      <li>The cattle and other animals like goats will have their conditions to ensure every learner is able to have a laptop by 4th grade.</li>
                                      <li>Collaborations with the school administration and parents' associations will ensure ease in coordination to achieve these objectives.</li>
                                      <li>ADIA will also establish crop centers and warehouses where farmers can sell their produce during harvest and drought seasons. This is part of ADIA's efforts to ensure food security and promote other sectors of the economy.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                  
                                    <h3>Farmer Benefits:</h3>
                                    <ul>
                                      <li>Subsidized costs of farm inputs with free delivery.</li>
                                      <li>Free consultancy on different agricultural needs.</li>
                                      <li>Training on best farm practices for maximum production.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                  
                                    <h3>ADIA Farm's Priorities:</h3>
                                    <p>The priority of ADIA farms will be local inputs and production mechanisms that will fully benefit the farmers. The centers will serve as "churches" for food security in the society. ADIA, together with partners, will offer subsidized costs to farm inputs and, in some cases, offer grants to aid in the promotion of farming.</p>
                                  
                                    <h3>Support for Farmers:</h3>
                                    <p>ADIA will also assist in ploughing for its members to make farm production much cheaper at the onset of farming. This will be done on a regional basis. To qualify for this, there must be a written request that should be passed through different offices. The request must also involve more than 10 applicants in the same region at the time of making the request.</p>
                                  
                                    <p>The crops that are a priority to ADIA are maize, beans, groundnuts, millet, and sorghum, with others depending on the productivity of the land. The animals prioritized by ADIA farms will include cattle (both), goats, sheep, and hens.</p>
                                  
                                    <h3>Implementation and Coordination:</h3>
                                    <p>ADIA's technical team will collaborate to fully implement the Agro-Tech Campaign project and ensure the release of laptops to beneficiaries who meet the requirements.</p>

                                    <p>Digital Inclusion means leaving no one behind as part of our efforts to make these workshops accessible to all Schools that are not able to be financially included in the program will be placed under the tech rally where the ADIA move from one institution to another by having workshops with the leaners within stipulated time. As ADIA this will be done freely since our organization is non-profit.</p>
                                    <p>It will be initiated through request to the target schools which will have to agree to participate in our tech rally missions.</p>
                                    <p>The fast young learners will also be used as strong advocates and participants to these missions as this will make them network and share their experiences on technology with those young learners who are unaware.</p>
                                    <p>This project will be fully funded by ADIA and its partners to make sure it becomes part of the outreach plans to reach areas that are deep seated in rural areas.</p>
                                    <p>The ADIA will have their regional heads and ambassadors to make sure we are able to map the whole continent to participate in the same journey of accessing all the regions into the program.</p>
                                    <p>Tech rally will also be an awareness creation from one tertiary institution to another to achieve the networking abilities with the beneficiaries of this initiative. The tech rally will advocate for access to governmental services and on how technology makes life easier through different tools and products.</p>
                                    <p>ADIA will be prioritized to the technological products and solutions from the local ecosystem. Remember this is the marketing strategy of ADIA to increase its awareness and participants.</p>
                                    <p>The coordination of tech rallies will be made by the ambassadors and regional heads and the target will be fully on marginalized areas and schools for the program which is also a way to bring more schools on board.</p>

                                    <p>At ADIA we believe all our efforts to impact our society will also directly be linked to the surrounding climate and weather conditions. Thus, in our efforts to create a good environment has been addressed and redressed in the following strategy;</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Our financial distribution from every workshop held will be portioned directly to the climate action events. We will have more than 10% of total monies obtained going on improving the local climate ecosystem.</li>
                                        <li>We will champion for climate justice by promoting the use of renewable energy such as the solar panel computer labs.</li>
                                        <li>We will drill boreholes and connect different areas to have access to water to different areas.</li>
                                        <li>We will annually distribute trees to selected schools and participate in tree planting.</li>
                                        <li>We will have adoption of technology used in access to water in the deserts and we will aid in reclaiming the marginalized lands because of climate change.</li>
                                        <li>We will conduct community awareness and training on carbon emissions to the air and support initiatives that work towards recycling on different non-biodegradable products.</li>
                                        <li>Different green houses will be put in place to make sure we have a controlled atmosphere that allows massive food productions to allow food security.</li>

                                    <p>On climate Change and justice ADIA will be partner centric in the journey to localize our communities to be ardent champions of promoting climate friendliness and with this a good environment will be created for all other activities.</p>
